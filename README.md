Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a process for tracking and controlling changes in software development projects. It helps teams manage code versions, track modifications, and coordinate collaborative work across multiple developers.

Key aspects of SCM:
Version control – Tracks changes to code files over time

Change management – Controls how modifications are reviewed and implemented

Build management – Maintains consistent software assembly processes

Release management – Coordinates software deployments

GitHub's Role in SCM:
Repository hosting – Stores code and tracks changes

Pull requests – Facilitates code review and change management

Issue tracking – Monitors bugs and feature requests

Actions – Automates workflows and supports continuous integration

Project boards – Organizes tasks and visualizes workflows
