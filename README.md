# SCM-Practice-Trevino
Source Control Management (SCM) is the process of tracking and managing changes to code in software development. It helps teams maintain version history, collaborate effectively, and prevent conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project.

Key Aspects of SCM:
Version control – Tracks changes to code files over time

Branching and merging – Allows developers to work independently and integrate changes

Commit history – Maintains a record of modifications for accountability and rollback

Collaboration – Enables multiple developers to contribute without overwriting each other's work

Conflict resolution – Helps manage and resolve merge conflicts when changes overlap

GitHub’s Role in SCM:
Repository hosting – Stores code and tracks changes with Git

Branching and pull requests – Supports collaborative development and code reviews

Commit tracking – Maintains a clear history of changes for accountability

Issue tracking – Manages bug reports, feature requests, and project tasks

GitHub Actions – Automates workflows for testing, building, and deployment
